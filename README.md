## Running the Projects

I **highly** recommend using the Colab, but in case you want to do it on your local machine, follow the steps below:

```bash
# If you are using conda:
# $ conda install pip

# Clone project
$ git clone https://github.com/aaronhma/europython-2020.git aaronhma-europython
$ cd aaronhma-europython

# For CPU users:
$ pip install -r requirements-cpu.txt

# For GPU users:
$ pip install -r requirements-gpu.txt
```
